## Introduction

This solution uses a GDM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and Application Security Manager (ASM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Google Instance Group that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Google load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. Auto scaling means that as certain thresholds are reached, the number of BIG-IP VE instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly. Scaling events are triggered based on the utilization of the BIG-IP VE CPU (you configure the thresholds in the template), specifically the F5 TMM (Traffic Management Microkernel) CPU.
 In this solution, the BIG-IP VEs have the [LTM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) and [ASM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/application-security-manager-asm) modules enabled to provide advanced traffic management and web application security functionality.
 **Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

## Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites for the F5 autoscale 1 NIC GDM template:

- You must have installed the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)
- Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import this in Google Cloud)
- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with one subnet.  The subnet requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library.
- You must use a BIG-IP instance that has at least 2 vCPU and 4 GB memory. For each additional vCPU, add at least 2 GB of memory. Note: Because of this requirement, the *n1-highcpu* instance types are not supported.
- This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IP system. If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE (using an SSH key provided via project-wide metadata).  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.
- **Important**: This solution uses calls to the GCE REST API to read and update GCE resources such as storage accounts, network interfaces, and route tables.  For the solution to function correctly, you must ensure that the BIG-IP(s) can connect to the GCE REST API on port 443.
-  This solution uses calls to the GCE REST API to read and update GCE resources, this has specifically been tested in GCE Commercial Cloud.


## Important configuration notes

- All F5 Google templates include Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) v3.5.1 (LTS version) on the BIG-IP VE.  As of release 4.1.2, all supported templates give the option of including the URL of an AS3 declaration, which you can use to specify the BIG-IP configuration you want on your newly created BIG-IP VE(s).  In templates such as autoscale, where an F5-recommended configuration is deployed by default, specifying an AS3 declaration URL will override the default configuration with your declaration.   See the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3.5.1/) for details on how to use AS3.
- This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
- F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 Google GDM templates, and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See the matrix [here](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/blob/master/google-bigip-version-matrix.md).
- If you would like to view all available images, run the following command from the **gcloud** command line: ```$ gcloud compute images list --project f5-7626-networks-public | grep f5```
- This directory now contains a schema file which helps manage the required fields and set defaults to optional fields.  For example, if you omit the property for NTP servers in your configuration file,  we set the default server to time.google.com.
- Note that when configuring GCP failover, if no external public IPs are provisioned, a GCP alias IP range is required.
- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
- F5 GDM templates do not reconfigure existing GCE resources, such as network security groups.  Depending on your configuration, you may need to configure these resources to allow the BIG-IP VE(s) to receive traffic for your application.
- F5 GDM templates now capture all deployment logs to the BIG-IP VE in **/var/log/cloud/google**.  Depending on which template you are using, this includes deployment logs (stdout/stderr), f5-cloud-libs execution logs, recurring solution logs (failover, metrics, and so on), and more.
- This template includes a master election feature, which ensures that if the existing master BIG-IP VE is unavailable, a new master is selected from the BIG-IP VEs in the cluster.
- After deploying the template, we recommend going to [this section](#backup-big-ip-configuration-for-cluster-recovery) to create and store a backup of your BIG-IP configuration.
- Important: After the template successfully deploys, you must log into one of the BIG-IP VEs to modify the Application Security Synchronization settings.  Log in to the BIG-IP VE, and then click **Security > Options > Synchronization > Application Security Synchronization**.  From the **Device Group** list, select **Sync**, and then click **Save**. This ensures any changes to the ASM security policy are synchronized to other devices in the cluster.
- Scaling Thresholds: 
   - The scaling process gets triggered based on CPU usage 
   - The control CPU usage value is defined using a float number in a range of 0 to 1 ( i.e. 0.8 )

### Security

This GDM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the GDM template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code in each of the following sections.

- In the */config/verifyHash* section: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Google Deployment Manager templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see this [link](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014).

## Supported BIG-IP versions
The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIpVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IP version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IP VE is posted in the GCE Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.
| Google BIG-IP Image Version | BIG-IP Version |
| --- | --- |
| 15.0.10000 | 15.0.1 Build 0.0.1 |

### Help

**F5 Support** <br>
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the experimental directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

**Community Support** <br>
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 Google GDM templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

## Deploying the template

This solution uses python script and a YAML file to deploy the BIG-IP VE.  The YAML file contains the parameters necessary to deploy the BIG-IP instance in Google Cloud, and calls the python script to launch the instance.

- PAYG: [**f5-payg-autoscale-bigip-waf.yaml**](f5-payg-autoscale-bigip-waf.yaml)


You ***must edit the YAML file*** to include information for your deployment before using the file to launch the BIG-IP VE instance.

1. Make sure you have completed all of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. [Edit the parameters](#edit-the-yaml-file) in the YAML file in this repository as described in this section.
3. [Save the YAML and Python files](#save-the-yaml-and-python-files).
4. [Deploy the BIG-IP VE](#deploy-the-big-ip-ve) from the command line.


### Edit the YAML file

After completing the prerequisites, edit the YAML file.  You must replace the following parameters with the appropriate values.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| region | Yes | Enter the Google Region in which you want to deploy BIG-IP, for example 'us-west1'. |
| availabilityZone1 | Yes | Enter the availability zone where you want to deploy the BIG-IP VE instance, for example 'us-west1-a'. |
| mgmtNetwork | Yes | Specify the name of the network to use for management traffic, for example 'my-management-network'. |
| manGuiPort | Yes | Enter the BIG-IP Management Port, the default is '8443'. |
| mgmtSubnet | Yes | Specify the name of the subnet to use for management traffic, for example 'my-management-subnetwork'. |
| imageName | Yes | BIG-IP image name. |
| instanceType | Yes | Instance type assigned to BIG-IP, for example 'n1-standard-4'. |
| bigIpModules | No | Enter a comma-separated list of modules and provisioning level, for example 'ltm:nominal' or 'ltm:nominal,asm:nominal'. |
| serviceAccount | Yes | Enter the Google service account to use for autoscale API calls, for example 'username@projectname.iam.gserviceaccount.com'. |
| targetSize | Yes | Enter the number of instances to start. |
| minReplicas | Yes | Enter the minimum number of instances autoscale policy will scale down to. |
| maxReplicas | Yes | Enter the maximum number of instances autoscale policy will allow. |
| cpuUtilization | Yes | Enter the target percent of BIG-IP managed instance group utilization. A new instance is created once this target is met for the entire group. |
| coolDownPeriod | Yes | Enter the amount of time, in seconds, before collecting information from a new instance. This should be at least the time it takes to initialize the instance. In most cases, the default value of 10 minutes should be used. |
| policyLevel | Yes | Choose asm policy; valid values include - 'high', 'medium', or 'low'. |
| applicationPort | Yes | List application port(s) separated by a space, for example '443' or '443 444 445'. |
| applicationDnsName | No | Enter the DNS name used by application. |
| allowUsageAnalytics | Yes | This deployment can send anonymous statistics to F5 to help us determine how to improve our solutions. If you enter **no** statistics are not sent. |
| logLevel | No | Log setting, used to set log level on scripts used during deployment. Acceptable values are - error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly. The default is 'info'. |
| declarationUrl | Yes | URL for the AS3 declaration JSON file to be deployed. If left at **default**, the recommended F5 WAF configuration will be applied. Enter **none** to deploy without a service configuration. For example, ' https://cdn.f5.com/product/cloudsolutions/declarations/sample_01.json ' |


### Save the YAML and Python files

After you have edited the YAML file with the appropriate values, save the YAML file in a location accessible from the gcloud command line.  Save the [python file](f5-payg-autoscale-bigip-waf.py) in the same location.

### Deploy the BIG-IP VE

The final task is to deploy the BIG-IP VE from the **gcloud** command line.  See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/deployment-manager/deployments/create for specific information.

You can either create a new deployment from the [top-level YAML file](#deploying-from-the-yaml-file), or the [top-level template file](#deploying-from-the-template-file).

#### Deploying from the YAML file
To deploy the BIG-IP VE from the top-level YAML file, use the following command syntax:

```gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <your-deployment-name> --config <your-file-name.yaml> --description "<deployment-description>"```

Keep in mind the following:

- *your-deployment-name*<br>This name must be unique.<br>
- *your-file-name.yaml*<br>  If your file is not in the same directory as the Google SDK, include the full file path in the command.

### Backup BIG-IP configuration for cluster recovery

The template now automatically saves a BIG-IP back up UCS file (into the **backup** container of the storage account ending in **data000**) every night at 12am, and saves 7 days of back up UCS files.  If you make manual changes to the configuration, we recommend immediately making a backup of your BIG-IP configuration manually and storing the resulting UCS file in the backup container to ensure the master election process functions properly.  Note: If it is necessary to recover from this UCS backup, the system picks the backup file with the latest timestamp.

To manually save the BIG-IP configuration to a UCS file:
1. Backup your BIG-IP configuration (ideally the cluster primary) by creating a [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) archive.  Use the following syntax to save the backup UCS file:
  - From the CLI command: ```# tmsh save /sys ucs /var/tmp/original.ucs```
  - From the Configuration utility: **System > Archives > Create**
2. Upload the UCS into the **backup** container of the storage account ending in **data000**.

#### Deploying from the template file
To deploy the BIG-IP VE from the top-level template file, use the following syntax, and set each property key you are using:

```
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <your-deployment-name>       \
      --template template.{jinja|py}                                      \
      --properties "string-key:'string-value',integer-key:12345"
```







## Service Discovery

This Google GDM template includes the Service Discovery iApp. See our [Service Discovery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig_pQ_tqvsI) to see how to configure the Service Discovery iApp, and see this feature in action.

### Tagging

In Google, you tag objects using the **labels** parameter within the virtual machine.  The Service Discovery iApp uses these tags to discover nodes with this tag. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.

- *Tag a VM resource*

The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple GDM nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

If you want to verify the integrity of the template, from the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility click **iApps > Templates**. In the template list, look for **f5.service_discovery**. In the Verification column, you should see **F5 Verified**.




## Security Details <a name="securitydetail"></a>

This section has the entire code snippet for each of the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

### /config/verifyHash section

Note the hashes and script-signature may be different in your template. The important thing to check is that there is a script-signature line present in the location.<br>
