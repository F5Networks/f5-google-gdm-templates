## Stack Type
For each of the standalone templates, you must choose the type of stack into which you want to deploy the BIG-IP VE. See the individual README files for exact requirements.  Note that not all options are available for all templates, or may not be available at this time. 

  - **Existing Stack** <br> These templates deploy into an existing cloud network.  This means that all of the cloud networking infrastructure must be available prior to launching the template.
