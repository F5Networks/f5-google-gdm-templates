## Licensing Options
For each template, you have different options for licensing your BIG-IP VE(s). 

  - **BYOL** <br>Bring your own license (BYOL) templates require you have a valid BIG-IP license token/key that you enter in the template.  Contact your F5 Sales representative to acquire BYOL licenses.

  - **PAYG** <br>Pay as you go (PAYG) templates allow you to use hourly licensing, so you do not need to have an existing F5 license.
