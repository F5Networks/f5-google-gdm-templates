## Template Types
F5 Networks has created supported templates grouped into the following categories.  Currently, only Standalone templates are supported for Google Cloud.

  - **Standalone** <br>These templates deploy an individual BIG-IP VE. Standalone BIG-IP VEs are primarily used for Dev/Test/Staging, Replacing/Upgrading individual instances in traditional failover clusters (see Failover), and/or scaling out (for deployments where the configuration is managed remotely as opposed to relying on the synchronization functionality (config-sync)  of the cluster).
