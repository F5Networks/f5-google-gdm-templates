## Introduction

This solution uses a Google Deployment Manager (GDM) Template to launch two BIG-IP VEs in an Active/Standby configuration with network failover enabled in a Google Virtual Private Cloud, using PAYG (utility) licensing.

Google load balancers monitor BIG-IP's to determine which unit is active. Traffic is sent to active BIG-IP which flows from the BIG-IP VE(s) to the application servers. Each BIG-IP VE has 3 network interfaces (NICs), one for management, one for external traffic, and one for internal traffic.

The BIG-IP VE has the [Local Traffic Manager](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) (LTM) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.

**Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

{% block prereq %}
## Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites for this F5 GDM template:

- You must have installed the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)
- If using BYOL licensing only: An F5 Networks BYOL license (Bring Your Own License) available.
- Three Google Cloud Platform (GCP) networks with at least one subnet in each. The subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library.
- Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import this in Google Cloud)
- This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IP system. If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.
- You must use a BIG-IP instance that has at least 4 vCPU and 8 GB memory. For each additional vCPU, add at least 2 GB of memory.
- **Important**: For this 3 NIC template, you MUST use a machine type of at least **n1-standard-4**.  See this [link](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-use-multiple-interfaces#max-interfaces) for more information about required vCPUs and interfaces.  Note: Because of this requirement, the *n1-highcpu* instance types are not supported.

## Important configuration notes

- This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
- F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 Google GDM templates, and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See the matrix [here](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/blob/master/google-bigip-version-matrix.md).
- In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
- This template creates target instances for each BIG-IP VE as well as a user specified number of forwarding rules.  For more information on creating or modifying these rules see the google [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rules).
- This template optionally creates a single internal load balancer (TCP) forwarding rule which can contain up to 5 application ports. For more information on creating additional rules see the google [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/setting-up-internal).
- **Important**: This template uses the second interface as the MGMT interface.  This allows the first interface to be used by certain Google resources such as forwarding rules and load balancers.

### Security

This GDM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the GDM template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code in each of the following section.

- In the */config/verifyHash* section: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Google Deployment Manager templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see this [link](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014).

### Help

**F5 Support** <br>
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the **experimental** directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

**Community Support** <br>
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 Google GDM templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

## Deploying the template

This solution uses a YAML file for containing the parameters necessary to deploy the BIG-IP instance in Google Cloud.

- [**f5-deployment-template.yaml**](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-google-gdm-templates/blob/master/experimental/failover/same-net/via-api/3nic/existing-stack/payg/f5-deployment-template.yaml)

You ***must edit the YAML file*** to include information for your deployment before using the file to launch the BIG-IP VE instance.

1. Make sure you have completed all of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. [Edit the parameters](#edit-the-yaml-file) in the YAML file in this repository as described in this section.
3. [Save the YAML and Python files](#save-the-yaml-and-python-files).
4. [Deploy the BIG-IP VE](#deploy-the-big-ip-ve) from the command line.

### Edit the YAML file

After completing the prerequisites, edit the YAML file.  You must replace the following parameters with the appropriate values. For more information about the Service Discovery fields, see [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery).

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| region | Yes | The Google region in which you want to deploy BIG-IP, for example **us-west1** |

### Save the YAML and Python files

After you have edited the YAML file with the appropriate values, save the YAML file in a location accessible from the gcloud command line.  Save the [python file](f5-deployment-template.py) in the same location.

### Deploy the BIG-IP VE

The final task is to deploy the BIG-IP VE from the **gcloud** command line.  See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/deployment-manager/deployments/create for specific information.  

You can either create a new deployment from the [top-level YAML file](#deploying-from-the-yaml-file), or the [top-level template file](#deploying-from-the-template-file).

#### Deploying from the YAML file
To deploy the BIG-IP VE from the top-level YAML file, use the following command syntax:

```gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <your-deployment-name> --config <your-file-name.yaml> --description "<deployment-description>"```

Keep in mind the following:

- *your-deployment-name*<br>This name must be unique.<br>
- *your-file-name.yaml*<br>  If your file is not in the same directory as the Google SDK, include the full file path in the command.

#### Deploying from the template file
To deploy the BIG-IP VE from the top-level template file, use the following syntax, and set each property key you are using:

```gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <your-deployment-name>       \
            --template template.{jinja|py}             \
      --properties "string-key:'string-value',integer-key:12345"```

## Configuration Example <a name="config"></a>

The following is a simple configuration diagram for this deployment.

{% include 'CREATING_VS_FAILOVER_API.jt2' with context %}


{% include 'SERVICE_DISCOVERY.jt2' with context %}



### Documentation

The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Google Cloud Platform: Setup*** [guide](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-google-cloud-platform-13-0-0.html) details how to create the configuration manually without using the template.  This document also describes the configuration in more detail.


## Security Details <a name="securitydetail"></a>

This section has the entire code snippet for each of the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

### /config/verifyHash section

Note the hashes and script-signature may be different in your template. The important thing to check is that there is a script-signature line present in the location.<br>
