## Introduction
 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for F5's Google Cloud Deployment Manager (GDM) templates for deploying F5 instances in the Google cloud.  All of the templates in this repository have been developed by F5 Networks engineers. Across all branches in this repository, there are two directories: *supported* and *experimental*

  - **supported**<br>
  The *supported* directory contains Google GDM templates that have been created and fully tested by F5 Networks. These templates are fully supported by F5, meaning you can get assistance if necessary from F5 Technical Support.

  - **experimental**<br>
  The *experimental* directory also contains GDM templates that have been created by F5 Networks. However, these templates have not completed full testing and are subject to change. F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory, so use these templates with caution.

## Template information
Descriptions for each template, including how the templates are generated and assistance in deploying a template, are contained in the README file on the individual template pages.
